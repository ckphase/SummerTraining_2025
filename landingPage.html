      <p>
        Over the course of 45 days at O7 Services, I had the opportunity to contribute to a variety of real-world tasks—from daily design challenges to full-fledged development projects. <br>
        This journey not only helped me sharpen my technical skills but also gave me a deeper understanding of collaborative work, deadlines, and creative problem-solving.
